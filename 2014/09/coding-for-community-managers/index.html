<h4>Update: <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/coding-for-community-professionals">Our <em>Coding for Community Professionals</em> course in now available. Click here to view the syllabus.</a></h4>

<p>At MIWC we&#39;ve been pioneering a different way to learn to code. We believe that the best way to learn is by making real, useful things from day one. That&#39;s how every great developer that we know learned, it&#39;s how we learned and it&#39;s how we teach. Our first course, a general web coding course has so far taught well over a hundred people the basics of coding and it&#39;s been incredible to see people going on to build fully functioning web applications and some even move into development as a career.</p>

<p>But our long term goal is a bit different to most of the coding courses out there. We&#39;re not trying to teach people to become developers. We&#39;re finding ways to teach people enough code that they can build useful things that make their existing jobs better. That could mean automating boring but time consuming tasks, allowing them to make tweaks to websites and email templates without calling in the tech team or building internal tools to make everyones lives easier.</p>

<p>The challenge is that there&#39;s no &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution, the types of things people can usefully make with code will vary from industry to industry and this should be reflected in what&#39;s taught. That&#39;s why our next course will be focused on a single profession; community management. The objective is to take participants from no coding experience to being able to create useful things, in around four hours a week for 10 - 12 weeks.</p>

<p>The course is still very much in development and we&#39;re really keen to get feedback on it and adapt it to what you think will be useful. We&#39;ll cover roughly one topic in about four hours of study each week with some of the larger ones being split across two weeks. The course is designed to be flexible so if you want to take longer over it, that&#39;s fine as well.</p>

<p>As a starting point, here are some of the topics we&#39;re thinking of covering based on our conversations with community managers so far.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting all tweets containing a particular link to a spreadsheet</li>
<li>Estimating the reach of an individual tweet</li>
<li>Writing a custom Tumblr Theme</li>
<li>Authoring a Mailchimp email template from scratch</li>
<li>Creating and releasing simple web application</li>
<li>Building a high conversion landing page</li>
<li>Installing a wordpress blog and template from scratch</li>
<li>Automating data extraction and research with a web scraper</li>
<li>Using SQL Queries to generate reports</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re a community manager and you&#39;re interested, we&#39;d really like to hear from you. The more people we can talk to before finalising the syllabus, the more we can ensure that the things we&#39;re teaching are the right ones.</p>

<p>The final course will be available towards the end of the year but we&#39;ll be giving early access to everyone who gets involved early and helps us develop the sylabus. If you&#39;re interested just enter your email below and we&#39;ll be in touch shortly. Otherwise feel free to email me directly ben@makeitwithcode.com.</p>
