Year of Code is an independent, non-profit campaign that's encouraging people of the UK to "get coding for the first time" in 2014. Unfortunately, the thing that's set people talking about the initiative is the barrage of cynical responses to a recent Newsnight segment, which we think misses the point. Here's why we're completely behind Year of Code.

According to their website, Year of Code will "be banging the drum for all the fantastic coding initiatives taking place". They're not claiming to be teaching, they're championing the initiatives that are already trying to do so. This is an important distinction.

You see, the dirty little secret about teaching people to code is that no one has really worked out how to do it yet.

Some great sites, like Codeacademy and Codewars, are trying to teach syntax in a simple, engaging way while others, such as Treehouse, offer step-by-step video tutorials. At the top end of the price scale, smart initiatives like Makers Academy (UK) and Bloc (US) are applying the traditional apprenticeship model to coding. Here at Make It With Code, we're modeling teaching practices on the way today's best developers learned to code - by making things.

Each of these approaches is working well in some areas, and not so well in others. As more and more people start learning, we'll develop a better understanding of which combinations of methods work best and how this varies depending on the audience and goals. Teaching methods that work in the classroom may not work in a corporate environment, and someone whose goal is to make things will have a different impression of what's useful from someone who just wants to get better at working with developers.

Year of Code's strength lies in not being attached to any one methodology or approach. They're free to engage with all the great "learn to code" initiatives out there, pool knowledge from across the industry, and connect those who want to learn with the resources they need to get coding.
