In this series of interviews, we're talking to some of the industry's top developers about how they learned to code and their advice for anyone who's just getting started. Stuart Eccles is the Co-Founder and CTO of Made By Many, a London and New York based digital agency which specialises in applying Lean Methodologies and working practices to projects for big companies.

Their case studies <http://madebymany.com/case-studies> are well worth reading as examples of how to create great products; highlights include the Skype in the Classroom platform for connecting teachers and completely reinventing ITV's digital platform.

_What made you first want to start learning, and how did you start?_

I wanted to make games. I'd got a ZX Spectrum with some games but there weren't enough, I wanted there to be more of them and learning to code was a way to make that happen.

I started on a Spectrum so it was BASIC. I don't know if you remember these, but people my age would have these books that contained pages and pages of typed out game code. You'd go through and type them in manually, then save it to tape and try and run it. Sometimes it would fail and then you'd then have to go back through everything you'd typed to work out why it didn't work. Then I started to learn how to hack around with the games I'd copied from the books, how to change the game slightly in some way I wanted to.

_What's the first program you remember making and thinking "wow I made this"?_

The first thing I remember making on my own was a Carlos the Jackal type game where you had to infiltrate a city and assassinate a presidential target. It was a multi-stage type game which was part text adventure and part action, where you had to use the mouse and keyboard to shoot someone, then escape. That's generally the sort of thing I started off building.

_When you were first hacking around like that, apart from the books you've mentioned, what sort of resources did you rely on?_

Early on I had very few resources, a lot of it was just books and playing around. That was when I was learning BASIC, I graduated from that when I was 13 or 14. There was a guy who lived 3 houses away, who was just back from university, and knew how to do some serious code and taught me Assembly language. So I learned a lot more from him and was able to bother him with coding questions.

_Were there any particular tools you downloaded which you remember?_

The first 'learning tool' I ever used was probably the one which taught me C. When I was a bit older, I started using the bulletin boards and downloaded a DOS program that had lessons on parts of C, like pointers, memory allocation. You'd keep pressing Next through chapters and then it would have a quiz that you'd do. No idea what it was called, it was on my Dad's 386 or something.

The bulletin board meant I was able to connect with a few more people that knew about coding but this was very much pre the Internet of today. It was slow going.

_After hacking around with BASIC and Assembly, how did you move to programming as a career?_

As I went to university I stopped doing much programming; I was doing engineering and enjoying university life, as you do. My course was a mixed engineering course and we had a software engineering component in that. This was mostly embedded C, and most of the people on it knew no programming at all. When the lecture notes were handed out in advance, I realised I knew everything on the course and never actually went to any of the lectures and still score very well on the exams. It was aimed at teaching people from scratch so it felt ridiculously simple.

My formal education wasn't that advanced. I really didn't pick up professional programming until I went to Holland for 6 months to work for a place called DIMES, which was at TU Delft - the tech institute. That's when I learned Java; I was doing some work on a C-to-Java bridge, which was the first code I worked on as a programming professional. That was the first time I got to learn things off the Internet. I basically read through every bit of documentation on The Sun website, and then started just slowly building up this bridge.

_Did it feel strange going into professionally writing code when your background wasn't strict computer science?_

No, it was just awesome! I was working on Solaris machines, I was using Emacs, it was this whole kinda new world that I got into. And they had low expectations of the project, so I was able to wow them with some very easy stuff and then move on from that quite quickly. I just absolutely took to it. In those days, and we're talking about '97 - '98, professional coding was not what it is now. There was still quite an element of mystery about it.

_What do you think has changed about professional coding now?_

The level of resources available is so much higher now. I went back to university and did a masters and then I started my first consulting job as a professional software developer. Even then a lot of it was learning from books and a lot of trial and error. There were question and answer sites, but nothing to the degree of StackOverflow or Quora. There weren't the same community sites back in '99, it was all still new.

Now the level of resources available in the Internet is huge. That's a massive difference. You ended up being a lot more focused back then, you really picked a language and built yourself up in it. I would think "OK, I need to learn VB now" and then learn VB from scratch. I'd be very focused on that. Now I would find the level of resources quite unassailable, it feels like you have to learn many, many languages, many, many different tools. And all of the those things are changing very rapidly. I think there's almost a resource overload.

_Particularly with your specialty in building great teams, how has that change in resources changed what you look for in developers?_

It makes a big difference to the kind of people I look for. Previously, if you wanted to hire someone who'd hit the ground running, you had to believe they already had the necessary [programming] language skills to pitch in with the team.

Now I'm very much looking for adaptability, flexibility, the ability to learn something quickly, the right attitude and approach to things. The ability to argue a position very well. That, in a team, is very important. People who are going to be good generally are opinionated, but they're also able to have a debate about their opinions in a team. The difference now is that, with all those resources, you can expect people to get in and learn stuff very quickly. So I'm looking for some more fundamental, attitudinal skills rather than a language-based approach.

_So how does the distinction between Computer Science grads and self taught developers look to you?_

To be honest, (LAUGHS) as everyone who's worked for me will know, I put very little emphasis on formal software education. I have people working for me who both have computer science degrees and a lot of them who do not. One of my developers is an ex-professional chef, another, my Technical Director in the UK, did classical music at university, and lots of music engineering grads. I've found that actually having a formalised software education is not an indicator of ability one way or the other.

_If you were talking someone who'd got the attitudinal qualities you were looking for but had no background in coding and wanted to get started, what would you suggest they do?_

I think there are big differences depending on the reason one learns to code. If you just want to find out more about it, strangely, I would start with HTML.

I'd start with learning to compose a document in a markup language, it bears a lot of structural similarities to coding without going into areas such as logic and syntax. I would start with understanding how you take control of your environment, and that's a very good way of getting started on that step.

I have a feeling that some people drop in a little too far down the chain, in terms of learning computer languages, and then don't know what to do with it. You might learn HTML and then learn how to manipulate HTML with JavaScript, then you might learn how to dynamically store stuff and then you would kind of build yourself up a web talent set on that beginning.

_So where do you fall on the "is HTML code" debate? Do you think there's any value in distinguishing between HTML and Coding?_

I don't think there's any value in that distinction. To be dogmatic about what is and what isn't code and what is and what isn't programming misses the point of what you're trying to achieve.

I always argue that what we're trying to achieve with programming is to learn how to control our environment. And that environment is run by computers, so we're learning how to make computers do things for us. And that idea means that when you learn how to create something new, it's a way to learn to code.

_Is there anything I haven't asked about you think would be valuable to people looking to learn to code?_

One thing I believe that people miss in this environment is the shear amount of hours that go into it. There are some shortcuts for these things and you can increasingly learn more with less effort but I think we have to remember practice is important. Just doing lessons or reading is not enough. There must be a practical, practice aspect to it.

_Do you think all kinds of practice are created equal or are there certain types of practice that are particularly valuable?_

It's very purposeful practice, not practice by rote. It needs to be the sort of purposeful practice that gets you somewhere, gets you on the path of creation rather than on the path of learning. That means learning how to make the smallest kind of stuff for yourself and then learning how to make the next thing on from that. You've got to balance learning with practice, if you don't practice something it never sticks. So yes, it's a very purposeful practice that you need to achieve.
